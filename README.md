This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native: silent crashes on Android due to unhandled promise rejections within FlatList when fetching data asynchronously. The bug occurs when the network request fails, and the promise rejection isn't properly handled, leading to a crash without a clear error message in the console.  The solution showcases how to properly handle potential errors during the asynchronous data fetching process to prevent these crashes.
